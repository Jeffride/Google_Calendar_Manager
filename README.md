#Google Calendar manager

I made this app for adding my working hours for the current week to my Google Calendar. This was a tedious task to do as I 
had to individually add on each day the hours I would be working and the times along with other information which remained the same.
I decided to try speed up this process by developing a command line calendar manager using the programming language python.
