# Google Calendar manager

I made this application for adding my working hours in the current week to my Google Calendar. 

Adding my hours via the google calendar application was a tedious and time-consuming task ; I
had to individually add on each day the hours I would be working and the times along with other info which was always the same such as location and event title.

I decided to try speed up this process by developing a command line calendar manager using the programming language python. This app asks the user the days on which he/she is working followed by hours on these days. This greatly speeds up time updating ones google calendar, particulary with schedules such as a work roster which change weekly.
